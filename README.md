# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render despite being correctly defined.  The solution is provided to help others avoid the same pitfalls.

## Problem
The initial `App.js` file showcases a standard setup for nested routes. However, navigating to nested paths results in only the parent route rendering, not the child components.  This issue is fairly common and can stem from several factors such as incorrect path definitions or missing route elements.

## Solution
The `AppSolution.js` file contains the corrected code. The fix involves ensuring all the necessary components and path structure are correctly set in the `Routes` component.
